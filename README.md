but a video is not allowed to watch if the permission of the video is not set to **<u>Public</u>**.

   So, how to get the FB ID? You simply get it from the url of their Facebook page.

#### To-do list:

1. Not all of FB name/id from url are validate, basically it should be a number for ID, so need to get true target ID to get data.
2. Infinite scrolling for list of live videos
3. Supporting displaying autocomplete list of user's input ids on search inputbox.
